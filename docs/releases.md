| [1006](../patches/Telegram/lib_ui/0006-feat-let-scripts-swap-label-texts-and-find-full-widt.patch) | text a script changed in tele's windows comes back exactly as it was, formatting and custom emoji included, when the script stops, and rows a script adds to info tables stay above their last full-width line | with 301 |
